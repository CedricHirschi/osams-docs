# Welcome to this guide for Open Source Mixed Signal Design!

This guide will help you understand the principles of mixed-signal design using open-source tools. We will cover topics such as:

- Digital design with SystemVerilog
- Analog design with SPICE with XSCHEM
- Cosimulation of digital and analog components with ngspice
- Visualization of simulation results with XSCHEM and Python

By the end of this guide, you will have a solid understanding of how to create and simulate mixed-signal designs using open-source tools.
