In this setup, ngspice runs the analog portion of the design (e.g., transistor-level circuits, passive networks), while the digital portion (e.g., control logic, ADC state machines) is executed by an external HDL simulator. Communication occurs via a well-defined interface - ngspice exchanges signal values with the digital simulator at synchronized timesteps, ensuring that analog and digital events remain time-aligned.</p> <p>When using Icarus Verilog (iverilog and vvp), ngspice interacts through its d_cosim or d_process model, spawning the Icarus Verilog simulation process and passing data through pipes or sockets.
